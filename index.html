            <p class="column right">Hello! I am Michael Hellon. I am looking forward to becoming a Web Developer/ Full-Stack Software Engineer. 
            I have been interested in computer languages for the last 3-4 years. It all started with my kidsâ€™ interest in finding and installing 
            mods for Minecraft, and then progressed into building things with Arduino. I enjoy working with code and figuring out how to get the 
            programs to do different things, whether it is with pieces of equipment or different snippets of code.
             Within the next year, I plan on learning Python and C++. Then I want to learn C# and Ai languages to help with 
            machine learning. I am married with two wonderful teenagers, one still in high school and one attending college this fall. Some of 
            my hobbies include brewing homemade cider and wine, woodworking, and running.</br></br> I will be retiring in June 2024, from the US Army after 20 years of faithful service and multiple deployments. In 2010 I was selected 
            to go to the US Army Air Assault School and then US Army Pathfinder School. They were mentally and physically the toughest schools 
            I have ever been to. I look forward to any challenge that comes my way.</p>
