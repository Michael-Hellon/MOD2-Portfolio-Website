# MOD2-Portfolio-Website
Website to show case my Portfolio

## ## Description

- For this project my motivation was to create a professional looking protfolio.

- I built this project to showcase my skills. I still have alot of projects to add to this before graduation. I'm going to include Python and C++, and C# projects too.

- This project was supposed to show case my work. Right now thats not happening. 

- I learned I need to practice the CSS side more. specifically flexbox / responsiveness side of it.
