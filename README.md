# MOD2-Portfolio-Website
Website to show case my Portfolio

## ## Description

- For this project my motivation was to create a professional looking portfolio.

- I built this project to showcase my skills. I still have a lot of projects to add to this before graduation. I'm going to include Python and C++, and C# projects too.

- This project was supposed to show case my work. Right now thats not happening. 

- My first iteration of this project is definitely not 100%.I learned I need to practice the CSS side more. Specifically flexbox and building a responsive site.
